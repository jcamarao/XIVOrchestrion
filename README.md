# XIVOrchestrion
Firefox extension that tracks your system's time to determine if it's day or night (according to EZT standards), and allows you to pick an expansion and play the themes from the overworld while you browse. Made with manifest v2 as manifest v3 makes extensions like this impossible to do functionally and reliably due to the service_worker and persistence changes (Sorry, Chrome!).
