# XIVOrchestrion
[Firefox Extension Page](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/xivorchestrion/)

XIVOrchestrion is a Firefox extension that tracks your system's time to determine if it's day or night (according to EZT standards), and allows you to pick an expansion and play the themes from the overworld while you browse. Made with manifest v2 due to the manifest v3 changes with persistent scripts. 

I highly encourage you to buy the tracks. They're amazing.

You can find them here: [A Realm Reborn](https://na.store.square-enix-games.com/final-fantasy-xiv_-a-realm-reborn-original-soundtrack), [Heavensward](https://na.store.square-enix-games.com/heavensward_-final-fantasy_-xiv-original-soundtrack-_blu-ray_), [Stormblood](https://na.store.square-enix-games.com/final-fantasy-xiv_-stormblood-original-soundtrack), [Shadowbringers](https://na.store.square-enix-games.com/shadowbringers_-final-fantasy-xiv-original-soundtrack), [Endwalker](https://na.store.square-enix-games.com/final-fantasy-xiv_-endwalker-original-soundtrack-_blu-ray_)

Inspired by [Nook](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/nook). A big thank you to everyone who helped me test it and assist in creating the icons. :)

# How it Works
[![XIVOrchestrion](https://markdown-videos-api.jorgenkh.no/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2F382Mt75p2X8)](https://youtu.be/382Mt75p2X8)

XIVOrchestrion works by utilizing the browsers local storage by using `browser.storage.local` to keep track of states with listeners running in the background to keep things updated without needing the extension UI open. It also uses AWS CloudFront and S3 as the method of audio distribution to quickly load the themes regardless of where the user is located globally.
